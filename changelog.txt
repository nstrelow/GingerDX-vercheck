- PIE controls ported from ParanoidAndroid
	PIE is a fully-customizable replacement for the stock on-screen 
	navigation buttons found in more recent versions of Android. 
	It stays hidden off-screen, only to be brought to life by a predefined gesture. 
	PIE can be manifested on all four sides of the devices, and there's even an option 
	to set up multiple trigger areas, making this not only a neat mod to look at, 
	but a convenient one, too. (androidpolice.com)
